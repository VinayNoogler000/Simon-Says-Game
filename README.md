# Simon-Says-Game


Hey, I am thrilled to unveil my first frontend project â€“ the "Simon Says Game"!


In this game, players memorize and input a sequence of colors shown at each level. Matching the entered sequence with the game's displayed sequence, levels up the game, adding an extra color. Mismatch ends the game, restarting from the first level. The highest score is displayed at the game's bottom.


Tech Deep Dive:
HTML/CSS: Carefully designed a sleek interface featuring four colorful buttons for an user-friendly experience.
JavaScript: Applied DOM manipulation and skillful event handling to bring the game to life, ensuring seamless functionality.


Development Journey:
Started by creating four colorful "div" elements of button-type with HTML and CSS flexbox, crafting an inviting user interface. In JavaScript, I navigated through DOM elements, mastering event handling for a seamless user experience. Managed arrays (gameSeq[] and userSeq[]), initiated levels with the "keypress" keyboard event, and added dynamic color flashing using gameFlash() and userFlash() functions.


My frontend journey reached a new milestone with the completion of this project, and I'm excited to share the code for behind-the-scenes look!

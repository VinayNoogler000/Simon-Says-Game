# Simon-Says-Game

Welcome to my first frontend project â€“ the "Simon Says Game"!

## Overview

In this game, players memorize and input a sequence of colors shown at each level. Matching the entered sequence with the game's displayed sequence levels up the game, adding an extra color. If there's a mismatch, the game restarts from the first level. The highest score is displayed at the game's bottom.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS:** Carefully designed a sleek interface featuring four colorful buttons for a user-friendly experience.
- **JavaScript:** Applied DOM manipulation and skillful event handling to bring the game to life, ensuring seamless functionality.

## Development Journey

Started by creating four colorful "div" elements of button-type with HTML and CSS flexbox, crafting an inviting user interface. In JavaScript, I navigated through DOM elements, mastering event handling for a seamless user experience. Managed arrays (gameSeq[] and userSeq[]), initiated levels with the "keypress" keyboard event, and added dynamic color flashing using gameFlash() and userFlash() functions.

My frontend journey reached a new milestone with the completion of this project, and I'm excited to share the code for a behind-the-scenes look!
